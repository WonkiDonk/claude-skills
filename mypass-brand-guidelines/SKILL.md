- Ensuring consistency across internal and external communications

## Available Logo Files

The following logo files are included with this skill:

| File                           | Format       | Dimensions | Use Case                                                                     |
| ------------------------------ | ------------ | ---------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `MyPass Logo.svg`              | Vector (SVG) | Scalable   | **Preferred for all applications** - infinitely scalable, smallest file size |
| `MyPass_Extra-Small_100px.png` | PNG          | 100px      | Email signatures, favicons, small UI elements                                |
| `MyPass_Small_150px.png`       | PNG          | 150px      | Web headers, thumbnails, compact spaces                                      |
| `MyPass_Medium_200px.png`      | PNG          | 200px      | Standard documents, presentations (most common)                              |
| `MyPass_Large_245px.png`       | PNG          | 245px      | High-resolution displays, detailed documents                                 |

**Usage Guidance:**

- **Always prefer the SVG** for digital work - it scales perfectly and has the smallest file size
- Use PNG versions only when SVG isn't supported (e.g., certain email clients, older software)
- For print materials, use the SVG or request high-resolution (300dpi) exports
- Never upscale a smaller PNG - always use the next size up or the SVG
- The medium PNG (200px) is suitable for most presentation and document needs

**File Location:**
Logo files are stored in the skill's assets directory and can be referenced when creating branded materials.

## Brand Identity Elements

### Logo Variations

MyPass has three primary logo configurations:

1. **Icon Only**: Square format with coloured geometric elements on navy background
2. **Horizontal Logo**: Icon with "MYPASS" wordmark (preferred for most applications)
3. **Stacked Logo**: Icon above "MY PASS" text (useful for vertical spaces)

**Critical Logo Rules:**

- Never distort the logo proportions
- Maintain correct element spacing and alignment
- Do not separate or rearrange logo components
- Always use provided logo files rather than recreating

### Colour Palette

MyPass uses a vibrant, modern colour scheme:

| Colour Name | Hex Code | Primary Usage                              |
| ----------- | -------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| Navy Blue   | #09194b  | Primary brand colour, backgrounds, headers |
| Sky Blue    | #57c4e5  | Accent, highlights, interactive elements   |
| Pink        | #e1005c  | Call-to-action, emphasis, energy           |
| Orange      | #fd9e02  | Warmth, approachability, secondary accents |
| Green       | #00cbb2  | Success states, positive messaging         |
| White       | #ffffff  | Text on dark backgrounds, clean space      |

**Colour Application Guidance:**

- Navy Blue establishes authority and trust (critical for regulated industries)
- Bright accent colours (Sky Blue, Pink, Orange, Green) bring energy and approachability
- Use accent colours strategically to guide attention and create hierarchy
- Maintain sufficient contrast for accessibility compliance

### Typography

**Rubik Font Family** (Google Font - easily accessible)

| Weight       | Usage                       | Example Context                                      |
| ------------ | --------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| Rubik Black  | Large titles, hero headings | Presentation titles, report covers, All Hands slides |
| Rubik Medium | Subheadings, emphasis       | Section headers, key callouts, executive summaries   |
| Rubik Light  | Body text, detail           | Paragraphs, descriptions, supporting content         |

**Typography Best Practices:**

- Rubik's geometric design complements the logo's angular elements
- Light weight ensures readability in longer content
- Black weight creates strong visual hierarchy
- Medium weight bridges headers and body text

## Application Guidelines

### Executive Communications

- Use navy blue headers with white text for gravitas
- Apply accent colours to highlight key metrics or action items
- Rubik Black for document titles, Rubik Medium for section headers
- Maintain clean, professional layouts that reflect ISO27001 standards

### Presentations (All Hands, Board, etc.)

- Navy blue title slides with logo (horizontal version preferred)
- Accent colours for section dividers and data visualisation
- Consistent header treatment across all slides
- White backgrounds for content-heavy slides (better readability)

### Internal Documents

- Logo placement: top-left or centred header
- Navy blue for headers maintains brand consistency
- Use colour sparingly in working documents to avoid distraction
- Tables and charts should use brand colours for data categories

### External Materials

- Always include logo on first page/slide
- Maintain brand colour ratios: predominantly navy with accent colours at ~20-30%
- Ensure materials reflect the professional standards expected in regulated industries
- Consider accessibility: ensure sufficient colour contrast

## Brand Personality

The MyPass visual identity conveys:

- **Trust & Authority**: Navy blue foundation
- **Innovation & Energy**: Bright, modern accent colours
- **Clarity & Precision**: Geometric logo design, clean typography
- **Approachability**: Warm accent colours (orange, pink) balanced with professional navy

This combination is particularly effective for a B2B SaaS platform serving highly regulated industries - it demonstrates both capability and accessibility.

## Common Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Creating an Executive Summary

- **Header**: Navy blue (#09194b) with white text, Rubik Black
- **Subheaders**: Navy blue, Rubik Medium
- **Body**: Black text, Rubik Light
- **Highlights**: Use pink (#e1005c) or orange (#fd9e02) for key figures
- **Logo**: Horizontal version, top-left or centred (use `MyPass_Medium_200px.png` or SVG)

### Scenario 2: All Hands Presentation

- **Title Slide**: Navy background, logo, white text (Rubik Black)
- **Section Dividers**: Rotate through accent colours (sky blue, pink, orange, green)
- **Content Slides**: White background, navy headers, accent colours for data visualisation
- **Consistency**: Same colour represents same data category throughout
- **Logo**: Use `MyPass_Medium_200px.png` or SVG for title slide

### Scenario 3: Business Case Document

- **Cover**: Navy blue with logo and white title text
- **Executive Summary**: Use orange highlights for key ROI figures
- **Tables**: Alternate row shading using light sky blue (#57c4e5 at 20% opacity)
- **Action Items**: Pink bullets or highlights for urgency
- **Logo**: Use `MyPass_Medium_200px.png` or SVG on cover page

### Scenario 4: OKR Documentation

- **Status Indicators**: Green (on track), orange (at risk), pink (blocked)
- **Charts**: Brand colours for different initiatives or teams

### Scenario 5: Email Signature

## Technical Notes

### Accessibility Considerations

- Navy (#09194b) on white provides 14.8:1 contrast (exceeds WCAG AAA)
- White on navy provides excellent readability
- Ensure accent colours aren't used for critical text (may have lower contrast)
- Sky blue, pink, and orange work well for highlights but require careful application

### File Formats

- **SVG (Vector)**: Preferred for all digital applications - infinitely scalable, smallest file size
- **PNG (Raster)**: Use when SVG isn't supported, choose appropriate size for use case
- For print materials at 300dpi, use SVG or request high-resolution exports from design team

### Font Availability

- Rubik is a free Google Font - easily embedded in web applications
- Available via Google Fonts: https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Rubik
- Weights: Light (300), Regular (400), Medium (500), Bold (700), Black (900)

## When NOT to Deviate

**Absolute Rules:**

1. Never alter logo proportions or element arrangement
2. Never use non-brand colours for logo
3. Never use alternative fonts for branded materials
4. Never place logo on busy backgrounds without proper clearance
5. Never recreate logo from scratch - always use provided files

**Flexibility Permitted:**

- Colour emphasis based on document purpose (e.g., more green for positive results)
- Typography hierarchy adjustments for readability
- Layout variations to suit content type
- Accent colour selection based on context

## Integration with MyPass Context

Given MyPass operates in highly regulated industries with ISO27001 certification:

- Brand consistency reinforces professionalism and attention to detail
- Navy blue primary colour conveys the trust and security required
- Modern accent colours prevent appearing dated or bureaucratic
- Clean typography ensures clarity in compliance documentation

The brand guidelines support MyPass's positioning as an innovative, trustworthy partner for workforce management in sectors where brand perception directly impacts sales cycles and customer confidence.

## Version Information

**Current Version**: 1.0 (June 2020)
